# SurpriseMe

INFO
------
Project name: SurpriseMe

node.js 

INSTRUCTIONS
-------------
In order to run my project, please clone the repo and then run the following commands:

`npm install`

`node main.js`

I configured the server on port 3000.
Therefore, you should call my endpoint with a "http://localhost:3000" url prefix.

for example, "http://localhost:3000/api/surprise?name=Daniel&birth_year=2007".

I have written two test suites , Unit tests and E2E tests, if you would like to run them use the following command: 

`npm run test`

I have added another surprise for you - useless facts.
If this type was chosen, we should return a random useless fact.
This type will be chosen only if the userâ€™s birth year is divided by 3 with no remainders.

Enjoy :)
